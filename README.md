# Collection of Electron Ptychography Reconstruction results in my group
My collections of input files and results for electron ptychography reconstructions, including [fold_slice](https://github.com/yijiang1/fold_slice), [ptyrad](https://github.com/chiahao3/ptyrad) and [py4dstem](https://github.com/py4dstem/py4DSTEM).

The experimental and simulation data for reconstruction are collected or simulated in our group. The data can be obtained upon reasonable request.

Examples:
1. Zeolite sample from Sheng Dai's group, acquired at ThermoFisher Shanghai Nanoports and reconstructed by ptyrad.

2. Standard SrTiO3 sample from ThermoFisher engineer, acquired at Centre of Electron Microscopy, Fuzhou University and reconstructed by fold_slice.
